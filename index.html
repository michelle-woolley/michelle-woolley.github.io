         <p> My name is Michelle. I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family.
            I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania and worked as a nurse until June of this year.
            I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel. My favourite place I have travelled to so far is Hawaii, I loved learning about its history and culture.
            I have two cats, Luna and Artie, named after the cats in Sailor Moon.

         <h2 class="subHeadings">Interest in IT</h2>
         <p>I have always had a fascination with technology and the seemingly unlimited possibilities it can provide.
            I grew up around computers and was taught to not just use technology for entertainment, but as a source of education and development.
            I had long considered IT as simply a hobby, not as a career option, until I began to struggle with the mental health impacts nursing was having on me.
            I began researching alternate career paths and my partner, who works as a Business Analyst, encouraged me to explore IT further.
            He referred me to freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project so I could begin learning a different side of IT.
            Through using these resources, I decided I wanted to genuinely explore IT as a career and commenced studying at RMIT.
         </P>
         <p>There were two main factors which led me to choose to study at RMIT. The first, and main, deciding factor was the fact my partner achieved his Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
            He found the course to be well rounded and taught him the skills to be able to work in a number of different IT roles.
            The second reason is it gives me the ability to study online. I completed my first degree on campus, however, the final year of study was conducted online and
            I found I was able to focus and learn at a better standard than I was on campus. Studying online through RMIT gives me the capacity to study where and when
            I am able to and study in a way that best suits my learning style.
         </p>
         <p>Throughtout my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a broad range of skills that will prepare me to work in a variety of different IT roles.
            Things I expect to learn include: how to program using different languages; different IT systems and how to apply this knowledge in building them;
            database concepts; security concepts; and web development and design concepts. Other important skills I expect to learn are problem-solving, communication,
            and teamwork; as each of these will not only be beneficial but necessary to work in the IT field.

           <h3 class="headlines">Job description</h3>
           <p> This job application is searching for someone with the capabilities of a web developer who is able to work in a team with UI/UX designers to assist with the
              more technical aspects of designing websites and web applications. This position is particularly appealing to me for a number of reasons.
              Web development is currently what I believe my ideal job would be. I enjoy design but I also enjoy the technical aspects that come hand in hand with working
              as a web developer and this seems to be what the company is looking for. The company, Easy Weddings, also appealed to my personal interests and I believe working
              for a company that interests you could contribute to making the job an enjoyable experience.
           </p>
           <h3 class="headlines">Skills, qualifications, and experience needed</h3>
           <p>Easy weddings are looking to employ someone who has substantial experience in the Front-End web development industry with skills in Javascript,
              React, HTML5, CSS3, and Git. They want someone who is proactive, has good attention to detail and communications skills, and who is able to work as part of
              a team; potentially taking on more of a leadership role within it. Skills that will make an applicant more desirable include experience in .NET environments and
              exposure to Redux and JS unit testing.
           </p>
           <h3 class="headlines">Current skills, qualifications, and experience</h3>
           <p>I have basic skills in Java, having completed Introduction to Programming last semester. As previously mentioned, I have completed self-directed learning in HTML,
              CSS, and Javascript through the free online courses offered on freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.
           </p>
           <h3 class="headlines">Plan to achieve the required skills, qualifications, and experience</h3>
           <p>To begin with, I would complete a Bachelor of IT, minoring in Internet Design, while continuing to do my own self-learning to further build skills in Javascript,
              HTML, CSS, and Git. Ideally, I would aim to gain employment as a graduate in a junior role to build my web development skills within a workplace environment
              which would also help to develop teamwork and communication skills. I would continue to work in web development roles to build my experience until I had the necessary
              skills and experience behind me to work in this role at Easy Weddings.

         <p>I have done a number of these tests throughout my life, particularly when I was younger and trying to decide on a career direction.
            For this reason, I do not put too much weight behind the results provided as these personality tests pointed me in the direction of a career I ended up being unsatisfied with.
            Having said this, a lot of the results accurately reflect my personality. My strengths include: kindness, enthusiasm, loyalty, hard-working, and supportiveness.
            My weaknesses include: shyness, over-sensitivity, taking on more than I can do alone, getting taken advantage of, and keeping my feelings to myself.
            My weaknesses are something I have worked on and tried to overcome as I have gotten older, particularly when I entered the nursing industry.
            These weaknesses are certainly still present as aspects of my personality, however, it is to a lesser extent than what it was when I was younger.
         </p>
         <p>Having worked in teams many times before, I know I can be held back at times by my shyness and feeling like my ideas and inputs are not good enough which can lead me
            to not contributing as much in these areas. As mentioned previously, I have worked to try and overcome these weaknesses and my experience as a nurse has made me much more confident
            when working as part of a team and contributing my ideas. While it may take time for me to gain initial confidence within the group, once I am comfortable I feel I will be a good
            addition to the team. I will be able to contribute my strengths of a hard-working, supportive attitude, and wanting to help other team members when they need it.
         </P>
         <p>I feel having an even mix of people with different strengths is beneficial when working as part of a team. Being aware of each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and being able
            to support and help my team members in areas where they may struggle is one of my useful strengths I believe I can contribute to the team. I think my biggest weakness is my shyness,
            therefore, It would be beneficial for me to work in a group which has some members who are able to take more of a leadership role within the group while I build my confidence in the
            setting. I feel it would be helpful to work within a group of people that have a similar learning style and driven attitude towards work that I have. As reflected in the results of the
            learning styles test, working with people who like to plan and gather information before commencing a project would help to avoid issues which may arise from working with people with
            conflicting learning styles.
