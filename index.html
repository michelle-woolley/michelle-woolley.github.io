      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Student Number: s3858026
         Email: s3858026@student.rmit.edu.au
         My name is Michelle. I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family.
         I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania and worked as a nurse until June of this year.
         I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel. My favourite place I have travelled to so far is Hawaii, I loved learning about its history and culture.
         I have two cats, Luna and Artie, named after the cats in Sailor Moon.
      </p>
      <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
      <p>I have always had a fascination with technology and the seemingly unlimited possibilities it can provide.
         I grew up around computers and was taught to not just use technology for entertainment, but as a source of education and development.
         I had long considered IT as simply a hobby, not as a career option, until I began to struggle with the mental health impacts nursing was having on me.
         I began researching alternate career paths and my partner, who works as a Business Analyst, encouraged me to explore IT further.
         He referred me to freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project so I could begin learning a different side of IT.
         Through using these resources, I decided I wanted to genuinely explore IT as a career and commenced studying at RMIT.
      </P>
      <p>There were two main factors which led me to choose to study at RMIT. The first, and main, deciding factor was the fact my partner achieved his Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
         He found the course to be well rounded and taught him the skills to be able to work in a number of different IT roles.
         The second reason it gives me the ability to study online. I completed my first degree on campus, however, the final year of study was conducted online and
         I found I was able to focus and learn at a better standard than I was on campus. Studying online through RMIT gives me the capacity to study where and when
         I am able to and study in a way that best suits my learning style.
      </p>
      <p>Throughtout my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a broad range of skills that will prepare me to work in a variety of different IT roles.
         Things I expect to learn include: how to program using different languages; different IT systems and how to apply this knowledge in building them;
         database concepts; security concepts; and web development and design concepts. Other important skills I expect to learn are problem-solving, communication,
         and teamwork; as each of these will not only be beneficial but necessary to work in the IT field.
      </P>
      <h4>My Ideal Job</h4>

      <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50498888?type=standout">Frontend Developer job advertisement</a>
      <strong>Job description</strong>
      <p>This job application is searching for someone with the capabilities of a web developer who is able to work in a team with UI/UX designers to assist with the
         more technical aspects of designing websites and web applications. This position is particularly appealing to me for a number of reasons.
         Web development is currently what I believe my ideal job would be. I enjoy design but I also enjoy the technical aspects that come hand in hand with working
         as a web developer and this seems to be what the company is looking for. The company, Easy Weddings, also appealed to my personal interests and I believe working
         for a company that interests you could contribute to making the job an enjoyable experience.
      </p>
      <strong>Skills, qualifications, and experience needed</strong>
      <p>Easy weddings are looking to employ someone who has substantial experience in the Front-End web development industry with skills in Javascript,
         React, HTML5, CSS3, and Git. They want someone who is proactive, has good attention to detail and communications skills, and who is able to work as part of
         a team; potentially taking on more of a leadership role within it. Skills that will make you more desirable include experience in .NET environments and
         exposure to Redux and JS unit testing.
      </p>
      <strong>Current skills, qualifications, and experience</strong>
      <p>I have basic skills in Java, having completed Introduction to Programming last semester. As previously mentioned, I have completed self-directed learning in HTML,
         CSS, and Javascript through the free online courses offered on freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.
      </p>
      <strong>Plan to achieve the required skills, qualifications, and experience</strong>
      <p>To begin with, I would complete a Bachelor of IT, minoring in Internet Design, while continuing to do my own self-learning to further build skills in Javascript,
         HTML, CSS, and Git. Ideally, I would aim to gain employment as a graduate in a junior role to build my web development skills within a workplace environment
         which would also help to develop teamwork and communication skills. I would continue to work in web development roles to build my experience until I had the necessary
         skills and experience behind me to work in this role at Easy Weddings.

      <p>I have done a number of these tests throughout my life, particularly when I was younger and trying to decide on a career direction.
         For this reason, I do not put too much weight behind the results provided as these personality tests pointed me in the direction of a career I ended up being unsatisfied with.
         Having said this, a lot of the results accurately reflect my personality. My strengths include: kindness, enthusiasm, loyalty, hard-working, and supportiveness.
         My weaknesses include: shyness, over-sensitivity, taking on too much than I can do alone, getting taken advantage of, and keeping my feelings to myself.
         My weaknesses are something I have worked on and tried to overcome as I have gotten older, particularly when I entered the nursing industry.
         These weaknesses are certainly still present as aspects of my personality, however, it is to a lesser extent than what it was when I was younger.
      </p>
      <p>Having worked in teams many times before, I know that I can be held back at times by my shyness and feeling like my ideas and inputs are not good enough which can lead me
         to not contribute as much in these areas. As mentioned previously, I have worked to try and overcome these weaknesses and my experience as a nurse has made me much more confident
         when working as part of a team and contributing my ideas. While it may take time for me to gain initial confidence within the group, once I am comfortable I feel I will be a good
         addition to the team. I will be able to contribute my strengths of a hard-working attitude and a supportive attitude; wanting to help other team members when they need it.
      </P>
      <p>I feel having an even mix of people with different strengths is beneficial when working as part of a team. Being aware of each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and being able
         to support and help my team members in areas where they may struggle is one of my useful strengths I believe I can contribute to the team. I think my biggest weakness is my shyness,
         therefore, It would be beneficial for me to work in a group which has some members who are able to take more of a leadership role within the group while I build my confidence in the
         setting. I feel it would be helpful to work within a group of people that have a similar learning style and driven attitude towards work that I have. As reflected in the results of the
         learning styles test, working with people who like to plan and gather information before commencing a project would help to avoid issues which may arise from working with people with
         conflicting learning styles.

      <h6>Project Idea</h6>
      <strong>Overview</strong>
      <p>This project involves building a mobile app that provides education and advice to cat owners in regards to items which are toxic to cats. Users of the app will be able to search for
         various foods, plants, cleaning products, and medications and will be provided with evidence-based information on whether they are dangerous to cats and what they should do if their
         cat has come into contact with a toxin. In the event a user believes their pet has been poisoned, the app will provide them with the capacity to find pet poison hotline numbers and
         veterinary clinics near them.
      </p>
      <strong>Motivation</strong>
      <p>It can be difficult for cat owners to find toxin information for cats. A quick google search reveals there is a variety of information available for dog owners, however, the same is
         not available for cat owners; particularly in relation to mobile apps. Due to cats being fussy eaters they are less likely to be poisoned than dogs (International Cat Care 2020).
         This could be a contributing factor as to why there are limited resources available for cat owners. Yet, as a result of their curiosity and the fact cats could groom toxic substances off
         their coats, poisoning in cats is not an uncommon occurrence (International Cat Care 2020). Factors which can lead to cats becoming ill after toxin exposure include their small size,
         ability to mask exposure, and their inability to break down certain chemicals (International Cat Care 2020). As a result of these factors, cats can be less likely to recover from poisoning
         than dogs (International Cat Care 2020). According to DeClementi (2014), one of the best ways to prevent pet poisoning is to provide pet owners with basic poison prevention information.
         Due to the aforementioned reasons, a mobile app would be an essential tool for cat owners to enable them to quickly find toxin information in the event of a time-critical poisoning.
      </p>
      <strong>Description</strong>
      <p>The main feature of this app will be the ability to search for and gain information items that may be toxic to cats. When opened, the app will display three selections the user will be
         able to choose from: search toxins, find a veterinary clinic nearby, and poison hotline numbers. When the user selects the search toxins option a list of the categories the user can search
         through will be displayed: food, medications, plants, cleaning products, and a view all option. The user will have the ability to either browse through the list or use a search bar to
         search for a specific item they want information about. When a specific item is selected, the user will be displayed the following information: a picture of the item; a description of
         the item; why it is toxic to cats; symptoms the cat will display if the toxin has been ingested; and treatment information.
       </p>

       <p>When the user selects the option to find a nearby veterinary clinic, they will be shown an input field to be able to enter their postcode. Once this is submitted, the user will be
         displayed with a list of the veterinary clinics within the suburb ordered from closest to farthest away. The details of each veterinary clinic will include the name of the clinic,
         clinic address, phone number, email address (if available), opening hours, and whether they accept emergency or after hours patients. The name of the veterinary clinic will be a link
         that when clicked on will redirect the user to the website for the clinic. There will be an option for the user to filter by a preferred veterinary clinic if they wish e.g., only display
         Greencross Vet clinics.
       </p>

       <p>When the user selects the option for poison hotline numbers, they will be displayed with a list of available hotline services they can contact for further information and advice. The
         information displayed will include the name of the service, phone number, email address, and operational hours e.g., whether they are a twenty-four hours service or have specific
         operating hours. The name of the service will be a link, similarly to the name of the veterinary clinic, that when clicked will redirect the user to the website for the poison hotline.
      </p>
      <strong>Tools and Technologies</strong>
      <p>MIT App Inventor will be used to build the app. MIT App Inventor is a free to use online visual programming environment which allows anyone to be able to build an app; regardless of
         their skill level (MIT App Inventor 2020). Use of this system will allow the development team to build the app regardless of whether they have programming capabilities or not.
         To be able to use MIT App Inventor, a computer will be required to run and use the system to build the app and an android device or emulator will be necessary to be able to test the
         functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <strong>Skills Required</strong>
      <p>As previously mentioned, MIT App Inventor will be used to build the app. For this reason, the team designing the app will need to have familiarity with how the program is used.
         MIT App Inventor has numerous tutorials available on their website to teach the developer how to use the program (MIT App Inventor 2020). As a result of this, finding the necessary
         skills for this should be straightforward.
       </p>

      <p> The design team will need to have access to and know how to operate an android device and a computer to be able to build and test the functionality and usability of their app.
         Android devices and computers are very widely used, it is not expected to be an issue to gain access to this hardware and find skilled users of the systems. If issues were to arise,
         there are a number of android emulators and user guides available online that would be utilised.
      </p>
      <strong>Outcome</strong>
      <p>As previously mentioned, education is one of the best ways pet poisoning incidents can be reduced and prevented. If this project was successful, pet owners would have an
         educational resource readily available to them to help them keep their cats safe. While cat poisonings will undoubtedly still occur, the risk would be significantly reduced and
         the possibility of death occurring would be considerably minimised due to the inclusion of veterinary and hotline contact details.
